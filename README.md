# DSBA_6165_Forest_Fire_and_Smoke_Detection
**Overview:**

This project focuses on the development of deep learning models for the detection of forest fires and smoke detections from images. Using AI-based computer vision techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the research demonstrates the effectiveness of pre-trained models cmobined with transfer learning and a technique called Learning Without Forgetting (LWF). The goal is to enhance detection accuracy, reduce computational complexity and maitain the ability of models to perform across diverse datasets.
